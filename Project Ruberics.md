## 1st Segment Ruberics
The final rubric covers points you'll be working on each week. The project overview covered these too, and you can find them in the assignment details for the fourth segment deliverable as well.

If you look closely, you'll notice that the deliverable requirements for this first segment fall into the same categories in the final rubric: Presentation, GitHub Repository, Machine Learning Model, Database Integration, and Dashboard.

Of course, the level of sophistication required for the First Segment deliverable will be much lower than that for the Fourth Segment deliverable. Also, you'll notice that some segments have more points in one category, and fewer in another, than the next segment. That's because the project builds over time, and while the intensive work may shift from one week to the next, it's critical to keep the big picture in mind.

Take a moment to read through the mastery requirements for the first segment.
