# PROJECT PURPOSE 
## Each segment's tasks follow:

### First Segment: 
Sketch It Out: Decide on your overall project, select your question, and build a simple model. You'll connect the model to a fabricated database, using comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, to prototype your idea.

### Second Segment: 
Build the Pieces: Train your model and build out the database you'll use for your final presentation.

### Third Segment: 
Plug It In: Connect your final database to your model, continue to train your model, and create your dashboard and presentation.

### Fourth Segment: 
Put It All Together: Put the final touches on your model, database, and dashboard. Lastly, create and deliver your final presentation to your class.

Many aspects you've encountered during this course are integrated into this final project. For instance, Python will be used to clean, prepare, and explore the data, as well as to complete initial analysis. Python libraries, JavaScript libraries (such as Data-Driven Documents, or D3, and Plotly), and Tableau can be used to create visuals to help tell your data story.

Use database integration (Postgres, MongoDB, or SQLite) to store your cleaned data. Also, implement machine learning to enhance your topic. Your work will need a showcase—use tools such as Tableau or JavaScript to build a dashboard to present your results. Finally, prepare and deliver a presentation that walks your class through your project, step by step.

To close, you'll write a short personal reflection after submitting your final project. This reflection provides you time and space to consider the experience, discuss team dynamics, and think about how you would describe the project to an interviewer.

Each segment and the closing self-assessment will be graded. The grading breakdown follows:

### Graded Unit	
Group or Individual?	Points Available	Percentage of Final Score
Segment 1: Sketch It Out	Group	100	19%
Segment 2: Build the Pieces	Group	100	19%
Segment 3: Plug It In	Group	100	19%
Segment 4: Put It All Together	Group	100	40%
Individual Self-Assessment	Individual	10	3%

### Presentation 
(25 points)
The presentation itself is worth 25 points, or a full quarter of your grade for the final segment. This is your chance to share a polished, interview or boardroom ready deliverable.

### Content
The presentation should tell a cohesive story about the project and include the following:

### Selected topic
Reason the topic was selected
Description of the source of data
Questions the team hopes to answer with the data
Description of the data exploration phase of the project
Description of the analysis phase of the project
Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project
Result of analysis
Recommendation for future analysis
Anything the team would have done differently

### Slides
The presentation should be finalized in Google Slides and include the following:

Slides are primarily images or graphics (rather than primarily text).
Images are clear, in high-definition, and directly illustrative of subject matter.
Live Presentation
Requirements for the live presentation follow:

All team members present in equal proportions.
The team demonstrates the dashboard's real-time interactivity.
The presentation falls within any time limits provided by the instructor.
The submission includes speaker notes, flashcards, or a video of the presentation rehearsal.

### GitHub Repository 
(10 points)
Your final segment deliverable also will include a link to your GitHub repository. Of course, since you'll be contributing to this repository over time, you'll also see repository requirements in the rubrics for the other three segments.

### Main Branch
All code in the main branch should be production-ready. All code should be clean, commented, easy to read, and adhere to a coding standard, such as PEP8.

The main branch should include:

All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
All code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project
Any images that have been created (at least three)
Requirements.txt file
README.md

### README.md should include:

Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)
Link to dashboard (or link to video of dashboard demonstration)
Link to Google Slides presentation
IMPORTANT
The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

### Individual Branches
Requirements for the individual branches follow:

At least one branch for each team member
Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the final segment (16 total commits per person)
Machine Learning Model (25 points)
In your first segment, you'll create a model mockup, importing data in the desired format and exporting data in the required format. In your second and third segments, you'll train your model and confirm it's working with your robust database. For the final segment, you'll submit your machine learning model, the description and working code, as well as the following information:

Description of data preprocessing
Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the team's decision-making process
Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
Description of how the model was trained (or retrained if the team used an existing model)
Description and explanation of model's confusion matrix, including final accuracy score
Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is solving.

If statistical analysis is not included as part of the current analysis, the team should add a description of how it would be included in the next phases of the project.

### Database Integration 
(25 points)
Just as you did for the machine learning model, you'll create a mockup or "dummy" database during the first segment of your project to make sure the model works. This mockup will follow the format of the expected database, but it will be simpler and likely in a CSV or JSON format.

For your final segment, you'll present a project with a fully integrated database, with the following features:

Stores static data for use during the project
Interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database, or database connects to the model)
Includes at least two tables (or collections if using MongoDB)
Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
IMPORTANT
If you use a SQL database, you must provide your Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) with relationships.

### Dashboard 
(15 points)
You'll demonstrate your dashboard during the presentation, but it is important enough to count as its own aspect of the deliverable. When building your dashboard, keep the following requirements in mind:

The dashboard presents a data story that is logical and easy to follow for someone unfamiliar with the topic. It should include all of the following:

Images from the initial analysis
Data (images or report) from the machine learning task
At least one interactive element
Either the dashboard is published or the submission includes a screen capture video of it in action.

### View the Full Rubric
You can download the full rubric and save it to your desktop. Review it regularly to make sure you're on track.

Rubric for the entire Final Project (Links to an external site.)
Now that you have an idea of what that final deliverable at the end of the fourth segment will look like, let's talk a little bit about how your team will work together to get it done.

# 1st Segment Ruberic
The final rubric covers points you'll be working on each week. The project overview covered these too, and you can find them in the assignment details for the fourth segment deliverable as well.

If you look closely, you'll notice that the deliverable requirements for this first segment fall into the same categories in the final rubric: Presentation, GitHub Repository, Machine Learning Model, Database Integration, and Dashboard.

Of course, the level of sophistication required for the First Segment deliverable will be much lower than that for the Fourth Segment deliverable. Also, you'll notice that some segments have more points in one category, and fewer in another, than the next segment. That's because the project builds over time, and while the intensive work may shift from one week to the next, it's critical to keep the big picture in mind.

Take a moment to read through the mastery requirements for the first segment.

#### Presentation 
(30 points)
Content
The team members have drafted their project, including the following:

Selected topic
Reason they selected the topic
Description of the source of data
Questions they hope to answer with the data
IMPORTANT
The content does not yet need to be in the form of a presentation. It can be text in the README.md.

#### GitHub Repository 
(10 points)
Main Branch
The main branch should include:

README.md

#### README.md
The README.md should include:

Description of the communication protocols
Individual Branches
Requirements for the individual branches follow:

At least one branch for each team member
Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the first segment
Machine Learning Model (35 points)
Team members will be expected to present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:

Takes in data from the provisional database
Outputs label for input data
Database Integration (25 points)
Team members will be expected to present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:

Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
Draft machine learning model is connected to the provisional database
Dashboard (0 points)
There are no deliverables associated with the dashboard for this segment.


# Work Definition
## What You Will Accomplish
By the end of this module, you will have created the foundation for your final project. By defining roles between your team members and establishing a communication structure beforehand, you'll already be off to a great start. Additionally, you'll complete the following tasks:

Decide on a topic for the project—think of a question that can be answered using data.
Create a repository for the project and invite the other team members to join.
Source a dataset that will suit your needs (you can even use multiple datasets if applicable).
Begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis on your datasets so that they're ready for analysis.
Include mockups of a machine learning model and a database.
Plan Your Schedule
Project weeks can be intense. Make sure to pad your tasks with extra time. There's an excellent chance you'll find yourself researching issues you've not encountered before, or that you'll want your code to do something more advanced than what has been covered in class. That's all OK!

# Deliverable 1 Foundation
Before jumping into your project work, you'll need to create a solid foundation to build upon. This means familiarizing yourself with your role and responsibilities for the week. Additionally, you'll need to establish communication strategies and prepare a repository. You'll create a mockup of a machine learning model for the virtual class, as well as a mockup of a database with sample data, or even fabricated data. This way, you'll have a firmer grasp of how you want these different pieces to interact.

By this week's virtual class, your team will need to come up with a question that can be answered with data, and you'll need to source the data you intend to use. During this segment's live session, your team will meet with your instructor to talk about your project topic—listen to the feedback before moving on to the next segment. By the end of the meeting, you'll know what you'll be working on for the remainder of the course.

Completing an exploratory data analysis will help you determine if your topic is viable or if further consideration (or even a different topic) is needed. It'll also help you prepare for that conversation with your instructor. It's a good idea to think about what metrics you'll be including in the machine learning portion.

Before meeting with your instructor, your team will need to complete the following:

Decide on a topic, source data, and perform exploratory data analysis.
Create a repository and establish individual branches for each team member.
Create a mockup of a machine learning model.
Create a mockup of a database.

Decide which technologies will be used.
Work as a Team
Once a topic has been agreed upon, each member will be assigned a role, indicated by a particular shape: square, triangle, circle, and X. Each shape, or role, will have an assigned task.

### X role --- Jack, Yodi
The X role is mandatory for teams of four and optional for teams of three. Later, we'll cover how the designations will work. For now, review the following deliverable requirements for the first segment:

X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project.

### Square --- David
Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository.

### Triangle --- Michael
Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps.

### Circle --- Kimi, Dinah
Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project.

1. The team member in the circle role is in charge of the mockup database. 
2.This means you're using a SQL-based database, including an ERD of the database and a document pointing out how it is integrated into your database and how it works with the code. 
3. You'll need to use either sample data or even fabricated data to test it. 
4. When you submit this database for your weekly grade, make sure you're submitting the data used for testing as well. 
5. Make sure to upload it to the repository along with the rest of the database-related work.
6. By the date of your virtual class, you're required to submit the mockup database to your instructional staff. 
7. This is a great opportunity to test out your new GitHub branch. It's just as easy to share a link to a branch as it is to share a link to a repository.
8. Once you're set up in your repository and using your branch, create a document describing the schema of the database (this can be a markdown document, or an ERD). 
9. Push the document up to the repository, then open a webpage to GitHub.



# First Segment: 
# Coronavirus Pandemic Playbook
## Project Topic and Description

Topic
Investigating the six most important factors that led to the spread of COVID-19 cases in states across the United States.

Gender
Age
Weight
Race
Political Party
Religious Affiliation
Income Level
Population Density
Audience
The National Governors Association has tasked our group, the COVID-19 Rapid Response Group: Preparing for the Next Pandemic will be presenting our pandemic playbook to at a COVID-19 response conference with the National Governors Association and to the United States Conference of Mayors. The two nonpartisan organizations comprised of governors from the U.S.'s 55 states and territories and mayors of U.S. cities with population of 30,000 or more. Typically these groups meet separately to share strategies across their jurisdictions, however, this conference is a rare opportunity for all executives to gather and learn how to better respond to the next pandemic and minimize the spread, deaths, and economic impact.

Why Should We Care?
As a capitalist society, some economic measures of success for the U.S. are jobs created and GDP growth. The COVID-19 brought the deepest recession since the end of WWII as the global economy shrunk by 3.5% and 114 million people lost their jobs in 2020. The impact of this shock is likely to be felt for years to come.

The Brookings Institute identified state capacity as one of three pre-existing conditions that amplified the impact of the shock. The COVID-19 crisis posed a critical challenge for policymakers as they needed to quickly reach workers and households during the abrupt economic crisis. There is evidence that if states were more prepared to handle a pandemic, economic performance would not have suffered as it did in 2020. Our nation's governors and mayors have the opportunity to learn where our countries weak points are that led to these incredible economic losses and mitigate them in a future pandemic.

[Another possible data APIs](https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev-guides/track-covid-19/)

[A database that we can consider] (https://covidtracking.com/data/download)


### Questions to Investigate During Project

1. What is the population per state at the beginning and end of the pandemic?
2. How has race played a role in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic?
3. Could the level of poverty and inequality affect the spread of COVID-19? If so what is the impact?
4. Did having medical insurance play a role in the cure and deaths?
5. What were the top 5 MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) impacted by Covid-19? (Def: MSA is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area.)
6. What were the top 20 uSAs (Micropolitan Statistical Areas) impacted by Covid-19?
7. During periods of Covid-19 case spikes, were there geographical or state areas that trended with these spikes?
8. Did political affiliation of areas have an influence on the number of Covid cases prior to vaccine distribution?
 
### Machine Learning
The machine learning model should answer:
Which model did you choose and why?
How are you training your model?
What is the model's accuracy?
How does this model work?

The inputs for the model will be covid cases by state, gender, age, weight, race, political party, religious affiliation, income level, and population density. 
We are using a multiple linear regression model because we have multiple explanatory variables 
(the independent variables which are the earlier identified factors) and we want to know how strong the relationship is between these independent variables with our dependent variable, which is covid cases. 
We are using a linear model as opposed to a logisitical model because our dependent variable is continuous. 
We will run the model with the hopes of identifying the largest factors that played a role in the spread of covid-19. 
We will be considering the R squared value and the standardized coefficient when running our model in order to consider if the model is well fitted and compare the factors to see which play a larger role. 
The sample equation that we are using to build the model is below:

yi=β0+β1xi,1+β2xi,2+…+βkxi,k+ϵi.

From an early perspectivce we have identified:

yi = dependent variable—the number of COVID-19 cases

xi1 = explanatory variable-the number of men and women

xi2 = religion

xi3 = race

xi4 = political party affiliation

xi5 = income level

xi6 = health care professionals/doctors registered by state


What is the model's accuracy?


### Communication Protocol 

We are utilizing the available and most suitable resources as our communication tools. Zoom and Slack. We are aiming to meet twice a week in addition to meeting and discussing over the regular virtual class hours. 
We have created a group and direct messages for group members in Slack, and we may use this channel for any cases of emergency. 

### Technologies Used

#### Database storage

We will use SQL database tool to extract, organize and retrieve our data.

#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean and transform the data and perform an exploratory analysis. 

#### Dashboard

We will create an HTML/CSS portfolio to showcase our project and Bootstrap components to polish and customize the portfolio. We will also use JavaScript functions to display dynamic and interactive dashboard. 

#### Machine Learning 

During this segment, the team will continue to work on their analysis of the data. Make sure to really explore what the data has to offer and continue to refine how machine learning will help solve the question or provide an enhancement to the project. This means moving from a preliminary model into your machine learning model. The mockup database created last week will need to be integrated and refined as well, and the visuals that help tell the data story will need to be created.


## 2nd Segment Ruberic
The final rubric covers points you'll be working on each week. The project overview covered these too, and you can find them in the assignment details for the fourth segment 

Let's take a look at how these assignments are distributed across the roles:

### Team: 
Continue with analysis: add, commit, push, create new branches as needed, and utilize GitHub's built-in tools, such as PRs, to review the work you and your teammates have completed (this is an ongoing process, so keep it up!).

### Square: 
Refine the machine learning model you'll be using (train and test).
Triangle: Transform the mockup database into a full database that integrates with your work.

### Circle: 
Continue with analysis and create visuals to accompany the data story.

### X: 
Outline and begin work on a dashboard to house your final project. Check and test the work completed against the rubric.

Database interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database)
Includes at least two tables (or collections, if using MongoDB)
Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
IMPORTANT

Dashboard (15 points)
A blueprint for the dashboard is created and includes all of the following:

Storyboard on a Google Slide(s)
Description of the tool(s) that will be used to create the final dashboard
Description of interactive element(s)

### Square
During the second segment, the square will focus on the machine learning model. Building off of the preliminary model built in the first segment, continue to refine, train, and test the model. Make sure to document how it ties into the project. There needs to be a description of the model as well as any preprocessing that was involved. Additionally, capture an interpretation of how accurate, precise, or sensitive the model is.

One question: If you had more time, where would you like to investigate for finer tuning? Keep this in mind as the presentation is being put together since it could be a really strong talking point.

For this segment, continue using the same branch that was created during the last segment. If that branch has already been merged in, that's OK. You can just create a new one to work from instead.

There are several questions to keep in mind as you work through this segment:

How does it work?
Why this specific model?
What is the model's accuracy?
If there are statistics involved, what stats are being included in analysis and why?
If no statistics are involved, what would you include if you had more time?
There's a chance you'll run into stumbling blocks here or there, too. Remind yourself that it's OK and not to get stuck—instead of spending vast amounts of time stuck on a single problem, document it, then (during the presentation) discuss how you would approach it differently if you had more time.

At the end of this segment, you will need to have a description of the model and a discussion about any preprocessing involved. Additionally, an interpretation of how accurate, precise, and sensitive the model is should be included for the submission.


### Triangle

The team member in the triangle role is involved in upscaling the project's database. Last segment, a mockup database was created using either sample or fabricated data. Now we need to level it up to use the full static dataset that was sourced earlier. It's a good idea to create a new branch to work from for this task, to help track different versions the project will progress through.

Now let's take a closer look at the different database deliverables for this segment.

First, make sure the database is integrated fully and that it interfaces with the project in some form. For example, does web scraping add or update data? The same thought can be applied to the application programming interface (API) calls as well.

Next, there should be at least two tables (or collections if Mongo is being used) in the database. If you're collecting data on plants and their common locations, for example, you would have a table for the plant's information (genus, species, brief description) and a second table for geographic locations.

Additionally, there should be at least one join completed within the database. Using the same example from earlier, the two tables could be joined to show all of the plants' information and the locations.

Finally, there will need to be at least one connection string included. For example, if you're using PyMongo, you'll need to include a connection string in Python that demonstrates the link between your code and the database.

### Circle
The team member in the circle role will continue to refine the analysis. This includes generating at least three images to use in the presentation and with the dashboard. Imagine that the presentation, and the dashboard, are being shown to a potential employer. Not only do the images need to be neat and clean, but they also need to clearly add weight to the data story being told.

A good way to increase the quality of your images is to incorporate a visualization library, such as Seaborn if you're using Python, to make high-quality PNGs that can be reused as needed.

Create a new GitHub branch to work from during this segment. This is a great way to get feedback from your team on the visuals you create—they will be able to see them and provide feedback (and encouragement!) as you create them and experiment with different color themes.

It's important to keep in mind that the dashboard will require interactivity; so if you're creating maps using GeoJSON, this is a great time to make sure some fancy things are included, such as layers and filters.

### X
The team member in the X role will focus on the team's dashboard. Create a storyboard of a dashboard that will be used to display your data findings. Imagine that you and your team will be presenting this dashboard to a potential employer.

A potential employer may not be familiar with the dataset you've been working with. Or they may not have seen the specific technology you've used to create the dashboard first-hand. Even if they have, you want to create a dashboard that is easy to understand for everyone.

It will also need to include interaction—something more sophisticated than a tooltip. A map with multiple layers, for example, is a powerful tool. Or an interactive chart that can be filtered or has adjustable zoom can lend great strength to analysis. This is something to keep in mind and collaborate on with whomever is in the circle role during this segment.


Module 20 Second Segment Project Deliverable

Two segments down, and two to go! Congrats on making it to the halfway point in this final project.

IMPORTANT
Remember that every member of the team, regardless of his or her role, will need to submit all of the deliverables for each segment.

Be sure to carefully review any feedback your instructor may give you on your work, as that feedback will help you improve and correct course, if need be.

Rubric
Now that you’re ready to submit, make sure that you have all the deliverables in place by reviewing the rubric one final time.
