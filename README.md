# PROJECT PURPOSE 
## Each segment's tasks follow:

First Segment: Sketch It Out: Decide on your overall project, select your question, and build a simple model. You'll connect the model to a fabricated database, using comma-separated values (CSV) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files, to prototype your idea.
Second Segment: Build the Pieces: Train your model and build out the database you'll use for your final presentation.
Third Segment: Plug It In: Connect your final database to your model, continue to train your model, and create your dashboard and presentation.
Fourth Segment: Put It All Together: Put the final touches on your model, database, and dashboard. Lastly, create and deliver your final presentation to your class.

Many aspects you've encountered during this course are integrated into this final project. For instance, Python will be used to clean, prepare, and explore the data, as well as to complete initial analysis. Python libraries, JavaScript libraries (such as Data-Driven Documents, or D3, and Plotly), and Tableau can be used to create visuals to help tell your data story.

Use database integration (Postgres, MongoDB, or SQLite) to store your cleaned data. Also, implement machine learning to enhance your topic. Your work will need a showcase—use tools such as Tableau or JavaScript to build a dashboard to present your results. Finally, prepare and deliver a presentation that walks your class through your project, step by step.

To close, you'll write a short personal reflection after submitting your final project. This reflection provides you time and space to consider the experience, discuss team dynamics, and think about how you would describe the project to an interviewer.

Each segment and the closing self-assessment will be graded. The grading breakdown follows:

Graded Unit	Group or Individual?	Points Available	Percentage of Final Score
Segment 1: Sketch It Out	Group	100	19%
Segment 2: Build the Pieces	Group	100	19%
Segment 3: Plug It In	Group	100	19%
Segment 4: Put It All Together	Group	100	40%
Individual Self-Assessment	Individual	10	3%

Before jumping into the first segment of your project, take a moment to review the grading criteria for the final deliverable at the end of this four-segment project. It's helpful to start here so that you understand the end goal.

Below are descriptions of what "mastery" looks like for each criterion. Go ahead and read through each, and note any questions you have to discuss with your team and instructor.

Presentation (25 points)
The presentation itself is worth 25 points, or a full quarter of your grade for the final segment. This is your chance to share a polished, interview or boardroom ready deliverable.

Remember, you won't necessarily be graded on whether or not you've built the very best model. Instead, you'll be graded on your process: How did you select the model, and why? What roadblocks did you encounter (there are always roadblocks!), and how did you solve them?

Content
The presentation should tell a cohesive story about the project and include the following:

Selected topic
Reason the topic was selected
Description of the source of data
Questions the team hopes to answer with the data
Description of the data exploration phase of the project
Description of the analysis phase of the project
Technologies, languages, tools, and algorithms used throughout the project
Result of analysis
Recommendation for future analysis
Anything the team would have done differently
Slides
The presentation should be finalized in Google Slides and include the following:

Slides are primarily images or graphics (rather than primarily text).
Images are clear, in high-definition, and directly illustrative of subject matter.
Live Presentation
Requirements for the live presentation follow:

All team members present in equal proportions.
The team demonstrates the dashboard's real-time interactivity.
The presentation falls within any time limits provided by the instructor.
The submission includes speaker notes, flashcards, or a video of the presentation rehearsal.
GitHub Repository (10 points)
Your final segment deliverable also will include a link to your GitHub repository. Of course, since you'll be contributing to this repository over time, you'll also see repository requirements in the rubrics for the other three segments.

Remember, when you graduate from this program, you retain your repository access. Often, interviewers will ask for access too, so make sure you're putting in the effort to make your repository stand out.

Main Branch
All code in the main branch should be production-ready. All code should be clean, commented, easy to read, and adhere to a coding standard, such as PEP8.

The main branch should include:

All code necessary to perform exploratory analysis
All code necessary to complete the machine learning portion of the project
Any images that have been created (at least three)
Requirements.txt file
README.md
README.md should include:

Cohesive, structured outline of the project (this may include images, but they should be easy to follow and digest)
Link to dashboard (or link to video of dashboard demonstration)
Link to Google Slides presentation
IMPORTANT
The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted.

Individual Branches
Requirements for the individual branches follow:

At least one branch for each team member
Each team member has at least four commits for the duration of the final segment (16 total commits per person)
Machine Learning Model (25 points)
In your first segment, you'll create a model mockup, importing data in the desired format and exporting data in the required format. In your second and third segments, you'll train your model and confirm it's working with your robust database. For the final segment, you'll submit your machine learning model, the description and working code, as well as the following information:

Description of data preprocessing
Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the team's decision-making process
Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables)
Description of how the model was trained (or retrained if the team used an existing model)
Description and explanation of model's confusion matrix, including final accuracy score
Additionally, the model obviously addresses the question or problem the team is solving.

If statistical analysis is not included as part of the current analysis, the team should add a description of how it would be included in the next phases of the project.

Database Integration (25 points)
Just as you did for the machine learning model, you'll create a mockup or "dummy" database during the first segment of your project to make sure the model works. This mockup will follow the format of the expected database, but it will be simpler and likely in a CSV or JSON format.

For your final segment, you'll present a project with a fully integrated database, with the following features:

Stores static data for use during the project
Interfaces with the project in some format (e.g., scraping updates the database, or database connects to the model)
Includes at least two tables (or collections if using MongoDB)
Includes at least one join using the database language (not including any joins in Pandas)
Includes at least one connection string (using SQLAlchemy or PyMongo)
IMPORTANT
If you use a SQL database, you must provide your Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) with relationships.

Dashboard (15 points)
You'll demonstrate your dashboard during the presentation, but it is important enough to count as its own aspect of the deliverable. When building your dashboard, keep the following requirements in mind:

The dashboard presents a data story that is logical and easy to follow for someone unfamiliar with the topic. It should include all of the following:

Images from the initial analysis
Data (images or report) from the machine learning task
At least one interactive element
Either the dashboard is published or the submission includes a screen capture video of it in action.

View the Full Rubric
You can download the full rubric and save it to your desktop. Review it regularly to make sure you're on track.

Now that you have an idea of what that final deliverable at the end of the fourth segment will look like, let's talk a little bit about how your team will work together to get it done.



# Work Definition

# Coronavirus Pandemic Playbook

## Project Topic and Description

### Topic

Investigating the six most important factors that led to the spread of COVID-19 cases in states across the United States.
* Gender
* Age
* Weight
* Race
* Political Party
* Religious Affiliation
* Income Level
* Population Density

### Audience

The National Governors Association has tasked our group, the **COVID-19 Rapid Response Group: Preparing for the Next Pandemic** will be presenting our pandemic playbook to at a COVID-19 response conference with the National Governors Association and to the United States Conference of Mayors. The two nonpartisan organizations comprised of governors from the U.S.'s 55 states and territories and mayors of U.S. cities with population of 30,000 or more. Typically these groups meet separately to share strategies across their jurisdictions, however, this conference is a rare opportunity for all executives to gather and learn how to better respond to the next pandemic and minimize the spread, deaths, and economic impact. 

### Why Should We Care?

As a capitalist society, some economic measures of success for the U.S. are jobs created and GDP growth. The COVID-19 brought the [deepest recession since the end of WWII](https://www.brookings.edu/research/social-and-economic-impact-of-covid-19/) as the global economy shrunk by 3.5% and [114 million](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/covid-employment-global-job-loss/) people lost their jobs in 2020. The impact of this shock is likely to be felt for years to come.

[The Brookings Institute](https://www.brookings.edu/research/social-and-economic-impact-of-covid-19/) identified **state capacity** as one of three pre-existing conditions that amplified the impact of the shock. The COVID-19 crisis posed a critical challenge for policymakers as they needed to quickly reach workers and households during the abrupt economic crisis. There is evidence that if states were more prepared to handle a pandemic, economic performance would not have suffered as it did in 2020. Our nation's governors and mayors have the opportunity to learn where our countries weak points are that led to these incredible economic losses and mitigate them in a future pandemic.

## Questions to Investigate During Project

1. What is the population per state at the beginning and end of the pandemic?
2. How has race played a role in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic?
3. Could the level of poverty and inequality affect the spread of COVID-19? If so what is the impact?
4. Did having medical insurance play a role in the cure and deaths?
5. What were the top 5 MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) impacted by Covid-19? (Def: MSA is a geographical region with a relatively high population density at its core and close economic ties throughout the area.)
6. What were the top 20 uSAs (Micropolitan Statistical Areas) impacted by Covid-19?
7. During periods of Covid-19 case spikes, were there geographical or state areas that trended with these spikes?
8. Did political affiliation of areas have an influence on the number of Covid cases prior to vaccine distribution?
 
## Machine Learning
We have identified a multiple linear regression model as the best model in order to complete our project. The inputs for the model will be covid cases by state, gender, age, weight, race, political party, religious affiliation, income level, and population density. We are using a multiple linear regression model because we have multiple explanatory variables (the independent variables which are the earlier identified factors) and we want to know how strong the relationship is between these independent variables with our dependent variable, which is covid cases. We are using a linear model as opposed to a logisitical model because our dependent variable is continuous. We will run the model with the hopes of identifying the largest factors that played a role in the spread of covid-19. We will be considering the R squared value and the standardized coefficient when running our model in order to consider if the model is well fitted and compare the factors to see which play a larger role. The sample equation that we are using to build the model is below:

yi=β0+β1xi,1+β2xi,2+…+βkxi,k+ϵi.

From an early perspectivce we have identified:

yi = dependent variable—the number of COVID-19 cases

xi1 = explanatory variable-the number of men and women

xi2 = religion

xi3 = race

xi4 = political party affiliation

xi5 = income level

xi6 = health care professionals/doctors registered by state
